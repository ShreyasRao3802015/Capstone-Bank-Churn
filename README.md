<p>
  Customer Churn Rate is basically the proportion of customers who stop doing business with a company or service. This is one of the critical metrics that is considered by investors and economic gurus as it projects the socio-economic culture of a company. Amy Gallo in her article - <a href= 'https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers'>The Value of Keeping the Right Customers</a> for the Harvard Business Report claims two statistics :
  <br>
    <li>Acquiring a new customer is anywhere from 5 to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one</li>
    <li>Increasing customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by 25% to 95%!</li>
  <br>
  
  The methods employed in industry to keep customer churn rates in check is retention campaigns (incentive programs). However, this is a waste of the tangible and intangible resources if the customer services team is not aware of their target customer segment.<br>
  In this project, I have the subsequent objectives in mind:
    <li>Visualize which factors contribute to customer churn in the banking sector across three countries: Germany, Spain and France</li>
    <li>Build and deploy a prediction model that will predict whether a customer is going to churn or not.</li>
  
  <br>
  I also propose that the predictions are reinforced with the probabilities so that company resources can be targeted to those customers who have been predicted as they will churn but are close to the threshold probability; in simple words lowing hanging fruits!

<p>
  I have obtained the dataset from Kaggle (<a href= 'https://www.kaggle.com/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers?select=Churn_Modelling.csv'>Predicting Churn for Bank Customers</a>). It consists of 10000 observations and 12 variables. Independent variables contain information about customers. Dependent variable refers to customer status.
